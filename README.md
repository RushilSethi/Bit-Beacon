## Inspiration & Purpose

This project was primarily driven by the desire to learn and practice Redux and Redux Toolkit and especially for integrating blockchain-related features like MetaMask. As a complete beginner in blockchain development, I followed a tutorial from JavaScriptMastery to help understand the integration process. This app is my way of applying these new skills and improving my understanding of blockchain, Solidity and the user experience associated with such platforms.

The purpose of creating **Bit Beacon** was to explore practical use cases of cryptocurrency-related information and tools in a web application while gaining hands-on experience with ReactJS, Redux, and MetaMask.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install dependencies using "npm install"
3. Create a .env file in the root directory and add your API keys with proper variable names.
4. Start the app using "npx craco start"

## Technologies Used
- **ReactJS** for the frontend.
- **CSS3** for styling and layout.
- **Ant Design (AntD)** for UI components.
- **Redux & Redux Toolkit** for state management.
